id: ml-workspace
name: Azure Machine Learning Workspace
description: |
  A full-featured Azure Machine Learning workspace for data scientists and ML engineers to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models.

  **What's included:**
  - Azure ML Workspace with Studio access
  - Compute instances for development
  - Compute clusters for training (auto-scale)
  - Azure Container Registry for model images
  - Storage account for datasets and models
  - Key Vault for secrets
  - Application Insights for monitoring

  **Capabilities:**
  - Jupyter notebooks in the cloud
  - AutoML for automated model training
  - MLflow integration for experiment tracking
  - Model registry and versioning
  - Real-time and batch inference endpoints
  - Responsible AI dashboard

  **Best for:**
  Data science teams who need a complete MLOps platform for the full machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to production deployment.

  **Getting Started:**
  Access ML Studio at ml.azure.com after deployment. Sample notebooks and a starter compute instance are included.
