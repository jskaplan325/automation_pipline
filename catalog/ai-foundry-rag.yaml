description: |
  A complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution built on Azure AI Foundry with OpenAI, enabling you to build chatbots and search over your own documents.

  **What's included:**
  - Azure AI Foundry Hub and Project
  - Azure OpenAI with GPT-4 and Embeddings
  - Azure AI Search for vector indexing
  - Azure Blob Storage for document upload
  - Prompt Flow for orchestration
  - Sample RAG pipeline template

  **Use Cases:**
  - Enterprise Q&A over internal documents
  - Customer support chatbot with knowledge base
  - Legal/compliance document search
  - Technical documentation assistant

  **How RAG Works:**
  1. Upload documents to blob storage
  2. Documents are chunked and embedded
  3. Vectors stored in AI Search
  4. User asks a question
  5. Relevant chunks retrieved and sent to GPT-4
  6. GPT-4 generates answer based on your documents

  **Best for:**
  Teams building AI assistants that need to answer questions from company-specific data rather than general knowledge.
