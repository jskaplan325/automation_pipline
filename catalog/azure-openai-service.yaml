description: |
  Deploy a standalone Azure OpenAI Service with your choice of models for building AI-powered applications.

  **What's included:**
  - Azure OpenAI resource with selected models
  - API key management via Key Vault
  - Application Insights for usage monitoring
  - Private endpoint option for secure access

  **Available Models:**
  - GPT-4 / GPT-4 Turbo (most capable, best for complex tasks)
  - GPT-3.5 Turbo (fast and cost-effective)
  - Text Embedding Ada (for vector search/RAG)
  - DALL-E 3 (image generation)

  **Best for:**
  Teams who want direct API access to OpenAI models without the full AI Foundry workspace. Ideal for developers building chatbots, content generation, or code assistance features.

  **Getting Started:**
  After deployment, you'll receive your API endpoint and instructions for retrieving your API key from Key Vault.
