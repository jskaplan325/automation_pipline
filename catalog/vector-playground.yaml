name: Vector Database Playground
description: |
  A complete environment for experimenting with vector databases and building semantic search or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

  **What's included:**
  - Azure Cosmos DB with vector search enabled
  - MongoDB vCore cluster for document storage
  - Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint
  - Sample Jupyter notebooks to get started
  - Application Insights for monitoring

  **Best for:**
  Teams building semantic search, recommendation systems, or RAG applications who want to compare different vector database approaches.

  **Use Cases:**
  - Semantic document search
  - Product recommendations
  - Question-answering over custom data
  - Chatbots with knowledge retrieval

  **Getting Started:**
  You'll receive connection strings for both Cosmos DB and MongoDB. Sample notebooks show how to generate embeddings and perform similarity searches.
